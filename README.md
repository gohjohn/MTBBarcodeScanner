# Foresight
Winner of NTU ideasinc startathon Oct16

The idea for Foresight is a warehouse inventory system that uses existing CCTV feeds to that tracks where all items are.
Pairing the item location data with weight sensors would allow us to figure out what items are on the weight sensors.
And since each item has weight data, we can count the number of items, eliminating the need for manual inventory tracking/counting.

This is the "CCTV" (iOS app) used in the hackathon.
